## 🌟 Key Features and Functionalities

### 1️⃣ P2P File Sharing 📂
- **Functionality:** Enables users to share files directly with peers without relying on central servers.
- **Implementation:** Utilize distributed hash tables (DHT) for file indexing and retrieval, ensuring efficient and decentralized storage.

### 2️⃣ Real-Time Communication 💬
- **Functionality:** Facilitates text, voice, and video chats through direct peer connections.
- **Implementation:** Employ WebRTC for real-time media exchange, ensuring low-latency and secure communication channels.

### 3️⃣ Collaborative Document Editing 📝
- **Functionality:** Allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously in a decentralized manner.
- **Implementation:** Implement conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) to manage concurrent edits and maintain consistency across peers.

### 4️⃣ Resource Sharing 🖥️
- **Functionality:** Enables sharing of computational resources, such as processing power or storage, among peers.
- **Implementation:** Develop protocols for resource discovery, allocation, and management, ensuring fair usage and contribution tracking.

### 5️⃣ Decentralized Authentication 🔐
- **Functionality:** Authenticates users without a central authority, maintaining user privacy and control.
- **Implementation:** Use blockchain-based identity management systems or public-key cryptography to establish and verify user identities.
